## Description
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle game</a> has been popular on Internet in recent months. So, I wrote a program in Python that can solve the game. 



## Getting Started 
Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/lyhsieh/wordle-solver" target="_blank">repository</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/_JfcOB2PsCU" target="_blank">demo video</a>. The detailed guideline is provided there.

</center> -->


## Execution Result
The images below are just for reference. The result may be different due to the randomness in my program.
