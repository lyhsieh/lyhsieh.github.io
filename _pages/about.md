<b>Lin-Yung (Leo) Hsieh</b> received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from National Tsing Hua University in 2022. Currently, he is pursuing his master's degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Tsing Hua University. He is a member of the Vision Science Lab (VSLab), under the guidance of Professor Min Sun.

In 2020, he joined the Vision Science Lab, where his undergraduate research project centered on active learning. His primary objective was to enhance the performance of CarePlus.ai, a home care system utilizing AI. During the same year, he achieved first place in the MeiChu Hackathon Competition, where he developed a program for detecting cheating in online games. Furthermore, he served as a teaching assistant for Professor Jing-Jia Liou in the Embedding System Laboratory course in 2021.

Subsequently, he obtained an internship as a software engineer at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). He was responsible for implementing quantization on feature maps within neural networks.

His current research is focused on event-based human pose estimation. His goal is to achieve 2D human pose estimation using event cameras and build a dataset containing images and motion vectors. Additionally, his paper has been accepted as a poster at BMVC 2023.
