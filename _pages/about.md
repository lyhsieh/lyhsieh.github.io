<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

<b>Lin-Yung (Leo) Hsieh</b> received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from [National Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/) in 2022. Currently, he is pursuing his master's degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Tsing Hua University. He is a member of the <a href="https://aliensunmin.github.io/lab/info.html">VSLab</a>, under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://aliensunmin.github.io/">Min Sun</a>.

In 2020, he joined VSLab, where he focused on active learning for his undergraduate research. He aimed to improve the performance of CarePlus.ai, an AI-based home care system. During that year, he got first place in the <a href="https://2020.meichuhackathon.org/">MeiChu Hackathon Competition</a>, developing a program to detect cheating in FPS shooting games. Additionally, he worked as a teaching assistant for Professor Jing-Jia Liou in the Embedding System Laboratory course in 2021. Subsequently, he obtained an internship as a software engineer at the <a href="https://www.itri.org.tw/english/index.aspx">Industrial Technology Research Institute</a> (ITRI), specializing in feature map quantization within neural networks.

His current research is focused on event-based human pose estimation. His goal is to achieve 2D human pose estimation using event cameras and build a dataset containing images and motion vectors. Moreover, <a href="https://lyhsieh.github.io/sphp/">his paper</a> has been accepted by <a href="https://bmvc2023.org/">BMVC 2023</a>.
