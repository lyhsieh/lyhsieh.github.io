<b>Lin-Yung (Leo) Hsieh</b> received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from National Tsing Hua University in 2022. Currently, he is pursuing his master's degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Tsing Hua University. He is a member of the Vision Science Lab (VSLab), under the guidance of Professor Min Sun.

In 2020, he joined VSLab, where he focused on active learning for his undergraduate research. He aimed to improve the performance of CarePlus.ai, an AI-based home care system. During that year, he got first place in the MeiChu Hackathon Competition, developing a program to detect cheating in FPS shooting games. Additionally, he worked as a teaching assistant for Professor Jing-Jia Liou in the Embedding System Laboratory course in 2021. Subsequently, he obtained an internship as a software engineer at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), specializing in feature map quantization within neural networks.

His current research is focused on event-based human pose estimation. His goal is to achieve 2D human pose estimation using event cameras and build a dataset containing images and motion vectors. Moreover, his paper has been accepted at BMVC 2023.
